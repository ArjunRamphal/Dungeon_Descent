The heavy doors creak open, releasing a wave of cold air that sends a shiver down your spine. The atmosphere inside is thick with an oppressive, ancient stillness, the scent of aged parchment and dust heavy in the air. The towering shelves, crafted from dark, weathered wood, stretch upward toward a high, shadowed ceiling, their surfaces slick with time and layered in a fine film of decay. Rows upon rows of forgotten tomes and faded manuscripts rest in the dim light, each one a relic of a past long sealed away.

Your gaze drifts across the shelves, settling upon four volumes that seem to pulse with a faint, ghostly energy. Each book is bound in the leather of an era long past, its surface worn and cracked with age:

"The Cyclops Might": A thick, black-bound tome, its cover adorned with gold lettering. Its pages seem to hold the story of the unbeatable cyclops and his mighty strength.

"The Immortal Alucard": A slender, pale-blue manuscript bound in tattered velvet, its edges frayed with the wear of centuries. These pages tell the tale of Count Alucard the vampire who lived for centuries thanks to his extreme vitality prowess.

"The Weeping Wolfman": A massive, obsidian-bound book, etched with eerie, spiraling symbols that seem to shift in the low light. Its dark magic is whispered to unlock powers best left undisturbedâ€”ancient rites that allow one to obtain the speed of a werewolf.

"The Eyes of the Raven": A delicate volume bound in deep crimson leather, adorned with the emblem of a watchful raven. Its pages are said to grant an unnatural insight, allowing the reader to see beyond the veil of the living world, into the realm of spirits that haunt the castle's corridors.

Which book will you choose to read, and how will its dark secrets shape your journey through the cursed halls of the castle?
