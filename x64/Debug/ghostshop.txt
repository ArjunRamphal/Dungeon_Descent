You step into a dimly lit room, the air thick with the musty scent of aged wood and faint incense, clinging to the silence like a lingering specter. Behind a dusty counter of cobwebbed shelves stands Morwen the Witch of the woods, a gaunt figure cloaked in dark robes, her pale, sharp features illuminated by the flickering light of a nearby candle. Her eyes, though sharp, carry a depth of knowing, as if she’s seen countless souls pass through this cursed place.

"Welcome, traveler," she whispers, her voice soft yet strangely echoing in the stillness. "I am Morwen, keeper of forgotten things. You’ve found your way to my humble haunt. Perhaps you seek what the living can no longer offer, or maybe... your soul is simply drawn here by the whispers of the long-departed."

With a graceful, almost unnerving motion, she gestures toward a collection of eerie objects displayed before her: faded, tattered scrolls, odd vials of murky liquid, and glimmering stones that pulse with an otherworldly glow.

"I have a few items that may prove useful, or perhaps, they will offer you something else entirely. First, I offer the Elixir of Restless Slumber. A drink for the weary who have long been tormented by the spirits of the past. One sip will grant you a brief respite from the nightmares that haunt you," she says, her voice carrying an odd undertone of pity.

She presents a small vial, its contents swirling with a dark, iridescent liquid.

"Next, I possess the Phantom’s Breath. A vaporous mist that will shield you from the eyes of those who lurk in the shadows. It’s said that the spirits who inhale it vanish into the mists of time—just as you will, for a while," she adds with a cryptic smile, holding up a glass vial filled with a faintly glowing, lavender mist.

"And lastly, I have a Scroll of Lost Echoes. This ancient scroll contains the memories of those who have wandered too long through the forgotten halls. It is said that its words may unlock the secrets of the dead—if you dare risk what they might reveal," Morwen murmurs, unrolling a small, weathered scroll, the edges torn and burned.

The cryptic symbols dance upon the page, their meaning as elusive as the shadows surrounding you.

What will you do?
