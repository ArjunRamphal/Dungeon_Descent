You trudge through the crumbling ruins of an ancient tomb, your footsteps muffled by the shifting sands and the gritty dust that swirls through the air. The heat is intense, each breath heavy and dry. You enter a chamber where the floor appears solid, but a closer look reveals a section of sand that shimmers unnaturally, its surface disturbed by subtle, unsettling movement.

A figure in tattered remnants of fine clothing is sinking into this patch of quicksand, his arms flailing weakly. It's the Princess's butler! Panic contorts his face as he gasps, 'Help! The sands... they're pulling me under! I can't escape!' He struggles in vain, the sand reaching his waist.

He was a servant of the princess, he may know something, but a tempting glint catches your eye - a potion vial, half-buried but within reach if you let him sink. 

The sands shift and churn, and the air crackles with the weight of your decision.
