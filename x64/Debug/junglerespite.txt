You enter a small, serene chamber, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and moss. The room is dimly lit, with soft, flickering candles casting a warm glow on the stone walls. In the center of the room, a sturdy wooden well stands, its wooden bucket hanging from a rusty chain.

A small, weathered inscription etched into the stone above the well reads:

"Drink from these waters, and may they soothe your weary soul."

As you approach the well, you notice that the water's surface is calm and clear, reflecting the candlelight like a mirror. The air around you seems to grow quieter, as if the room itself is encouraging you to take a drink.

Drink from the well to restore some of your health, or search the room for any other clues or objects of interest.
