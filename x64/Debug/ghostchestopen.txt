You open the chest, revealing a glowing orb. As you touch it, a rush of magic fills the air, 
and a vision forms before your eyes.
In a dark, candle-lit room, Malvel stands before Sophie, who sits on a throne, her demeanor calm and assured.

“Are you sure they’ll believe this?” Malvel asks, his voice low.

“They’ll believe anything,” Sophie replies, a wicked smile crossing her face. “This kingdom will tear itself apart looking for me. And when they do… we’ll strike.”

Malvel nods. “Let the hero play his part. He’s just a pawn. We’ll use him to lead us to the heart of the kingdom.”
The orb goes cold in your hand, and the vision vanishes. A deep, unsettling truth settles in—you were never rescuing the princess. You were part of a much darker plan all along.
