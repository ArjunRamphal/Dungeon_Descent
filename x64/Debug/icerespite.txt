You step into a small, serene chamber, the air sharp with the crisp scent of frost and untouched snow. The room is dimly lit, with pale, flickering blue flames casting an eerie glow on the ice-covered stone walls. A thin layer of frost clings to every surface, and your breath curls in the freezing air.

In the center of the room, an ancient well of jagged ice stands, its crystalline bucket hanging from a chain coated in shimmering rime. The air around it is unnaturally still, as if even the cold itself hesitates to disturb the silence.

A weathered inscription, carved into the frozen stone above the well, reads:

"Drink from these waters, and may they mend the wounds of both flesh and spirit."

As you approach the well, you see the waterâ€™s surface, dark and still, reflecting the cold flames like liquid sapphire. A deep, endless quiet settles over you, as if the very chamber is waiting for your decision.

Drink from the well to restore some of your strength, or search the room for any hidden secrets buried beneath the ice.
