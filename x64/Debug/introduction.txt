You slowly open your eyes, groggily taking in your surroundings. You find yourself in a damp, dimly lit dungeon room. The air is musty, and the smell of mold and decay fills your nostrils. A faint glow emanates from torches mounted on the walls, casting flickering shadows around the room.

As you struggle to your feet, your gaze falls upon a pedestal in the centre of the room. Upon it rest four weapons, each one gleaming in the torchlight:

- A sword, its blade etched with intricate runes, promising power and strength.
- A throwing knife, its slender blade whispering of stealth and agility.
- A wand, its wooden length adorned with mystical symbols, hinting at magical prowess.
- A longbow, its curved limbs and quiver full of arrows suggesting a mastery of ranged combat.

Choose your path, adventurer. Select the weapon that resonates with your soul, and embark on a journey to rescue the princess, overcome treacherous landscapes, and confront the darkness within.
