With a roar, you drive your sword through Malvel's chest. His eyes widen in shock and fury as his body crumples, and he falls to the ground in a heap of dark robes and dissipating magic. A final scream escapes his lips, a sound that echoes through the chamber before fading into the silence of the lava-filled arena.

The chains holding Sophie’s cage shatter, and she drops to the ground with a graceful, almost rehearsed motion. She stands, her eyes locking with yours, and in a rush, she throws her arms around you. Her touch is warm, a stark contrast to the cold aura Malvel once cast over the chamber.

“You did it!” she whispers, her voice soft but filled with relief. “You saved me.”

You hold her close, the weight of the victory sinking in. The fire in the arena dims, and the oppressive heat begins to fade as you stand together. The sorcerer is dead. The princess is free. You’ve won.
You return to the kingdom with Sophie by your side, a procession of soldiers and citizens lining the streets, cheering your name. The king himself welcomes you with open arms, his gratitude overwhelming. "Our hero has returned!" he proclaims, his voice booming with pride.

You stand by Sophie, your heart swelling with pride as the kingdom celebrates its savior. The air feels lighter now, the threat of Malvel vanquished. The future seems bright.

Yet, as the celebrations continue, you can't shake the nagging feeling that something is... off. Sophie’s smile seems a bit too perfect, her eyes distant for just a moment. She’s the princess you’ve fought to save, yet a part of you wonders if there’s something more beneath the surface.

The kingdom hails you as a hero, and the crowd’s cheers wash over you. You should feel content, fulfilled—but the doubt lingers in your mind. You missed something in that dungeon. Something important. A truth left unspoken.

But for now, the kingdom is safe. The princess is free. And for a moment, that’s enough.
