Malvel lies defeated at your feet, his dark form crumbling into nothingness. The lava pools around you burn with an eerie glow, but your focus is on the cage above, where Sophie stands—free at last, but no longer the princess you once knew.

You step forward, your sword still in hand, your voice steady. “It’s over, Sophie. Malvel is gone. But I know the truth now. I know what you’ve done.”

Sophie’s eyes flash with defiance, but there’s a sadness in them, too. She looks at you, as if weighing her next words carefully. “You don’t understand. You never did.”

You hold up the letter, the hidden one you found, and the shopkeeper’s book—evidence of Falkreath’s suffering. “I do understand. Eldred… you loved him. He was the leader of Falkreath, the man your father had killed. You saw the kingdom’s cruelty, how they exploited his people, how they treated them like slaves, and you felt the weight of their suffering. But that doesn’t justify what you’ve done.”

Sophie’s eyes glisten with unshed tears. “He was everything to me. They killed him... just because he was trying to protect his people. They took him from me. And now they take everything. What was I supposed to do? Just stand by and watch?”

You take a step closer, your voice soft but firm. “I understand why you’re angry. The kingdom failed Falkreath, and it failed you. But revenge on the people of this kingdom—it’s wrong. It’s not justice. Killing innocent people... you’re no better than the ones who wronged you.”

Sophie clenches her fists, the rage simmering beneath the sorrow in her eyes. “I’m not innocent! I’ve lost everything. My father, my love… this kingdom destroyed everything I ever cared about. What else am I supposed to do?”

You take a deep breath, choosing your words carefully. “You’re right to feel betrayed. But vengeance will only make you like them. The people of Falkreath deserve justice, but revenge won’t give it to them. The king’s deeds must be brought to light, and the kingdom must change. You’ll help me expose the truth, but you must pay for your betrayal as well.”

Sophie’s shoulders slump, her anger faltering, replaced with quiet resignation. “I understand. I... I don’t know who I am anymore. What I’ve become.”

You take her arm, guiding her back toward the dungeon’s exit, where the path leads back to the kingdom. “You’ll have a chance to make things right. Not through bloodshed, but through truth. The people need to know what happened. You’ll be held accountable for your part in this, but together, we can seek the justice Falkreath deserves.”

Sophie nods, her expression hollow but acknowledging the truth of your words. “I’ll help you,” she whispers. “But I won’t ever forget… what they took from me.”
As you return to the kingdom with Sophie, the weight of what you’ve uncovered sits heavy on your heart. The journey has been long, the truth painful, but in this moment, you know that justice will come. The king’s corruption, the suffering of Falkreath—everything will be exposed.

But Sophie’s betrayal will not go unpunished. You’ll help her seek the justice she deserves, but her path to redemption will be a long and difficult one. For now, you have done what you could, and the kingdom will face the reckoning that’s been long overdue.
