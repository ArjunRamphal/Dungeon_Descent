You raise your blade—but do not swing. Instead, you let your aura swell, a dark energy rolling off you like a storm. The heat recoils from you, as if even the magma itself fears what you might become. The hounds hesitate, snarls fading to low, uncertain growls. One, larger than the rest, dares to meet your eyes—and flinches.

“You know who I am,” you growl, voice like thunder through the chamber. “And you know what I can do. Speak now, or I burn the truth from your bones.”

The silence stretches, until one of the winged beasts drops low, its skeletal wings folding. A rumble like a grinding stone spills from its maw—words, guttural and broken, but words nonetheless.

“She commands him… not the other way…”

You narrow your eyes. “The princess?”

The creature shudders. “Sophie. She whispers death behind silk smiles. Malvel follows. She leads.”

Another hound snarls, nodding with a twitching jerk of its head. “It is her wish. The king dies. His crown… soaked in blood. A father slain by his daughter’s will.”

You step forward, and the pack recoils like shadows before flame.

“Where?”

“Deeper,” the first hound rasps. “Through the molten gate. Behind the obsidian veil. The truth burns there. But so does she…”

With a flick of your hand, the hounds scatter into the shadows, wings trailing smoke and fear.

You are alone once more—but not without direction. Sophie is no pawn. She is the hand that moves the board, and the knife poised behind the king’s back.

And now… you know.
