You step into a stone-walled chamber, the heavy door closing behind you with a soft, echoing thud. At once, a wave of damp, penetrating heat envelops you, wrapping your body in warmth and loosening the tension from your limbs. The air is thick with steam, carrying the calming scent of cedarwood, heated herbs, and mineral-rich stone.

Soft light filters through slits high in the walls, casting golden beams through the swirling mist. Smooth benches line the edges of the room, worn from years of use, their surfaces warm to the touch. In the centre, a shallow pit of glowing stones crackles quietly as a fresh ladle of water hisses onto them, releasing a fresh burst of steam and the soothing scent of eucalyptus.

The stone beneath your feet is warm and dry, and the heat here is not harsh like the desert, nor dangerous like lava—but instead, healing. You feel the sweat bead on your skin, carrying with it the weariness of your journey, the aches of battle, and the weight of unspoken burdens.

Carved into a polished plaque near the door, the inscription reads:

"Let the heat draw out what the soul dares not speak. Rest here, and rise renewed."

You glance around the chamber—peaceful, still, yet undeniably sacred in its silence. A place to pause, to breathe, to mend.

Will you sit and let the steam cleanse your spirit, or explore the sauna’s hidden nooks for traces of those who came seeking the same reprieve?
