The ground shakes beneath your feet as the Jungle Golem stirs from the underbrush, its massive, vine-covered form rising from the roots of ancient trees. Moss and thick foliage cling to its stony body, which is adorned with twisted vines and glowing, amber-like crystals embedded within its chest.

With a guttural roar, the golem raises a massive arm, its stone fist crackling with the sound of shifting branches and snapping roots. The very air seems to grow heavier, thick with the scent of damp earth and the sound of distant, unseen creatures moving in the shadows.

Its glowing eyes lock onto you, and the earth around you begins to tremble as it prepares to strike. Vines whip from its body, tangling and reaching toward you with terrifying speed. The path ahead is cluttered with dense foliage, but there’s a brief opening—if you can outrun it.

Do you engage the ancient, nature-bound behemoth, or sprint past it, hoping to avoid the crushing blow of its wrathful swing?
