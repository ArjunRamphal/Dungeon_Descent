You carefully open the diary and read the first extract, her handwriting urgent and dark:
"The weapon is almost complete. Malvel promised it will destroy the kingdom in an instant—my father, all of them. They will pay for what they did to Falkreath."
"The device is powered by molten energy, hidden deep in the dungeon. Once activated, nothing will survive. I will be the one to rule over the ashes."
"I tell myself this is for Falkreath, but doubts creep in. Can I really do this? Can I be the one to end it all? What will be left of me after?"
"It’s finished. The weapon is ready. One command, and it will be done. But as I stand here, I wonder if I can live with the cost of my vengeance."
You close the diary, your mind reeling from the weight of Sophie’s words. The weapon, the mass destruction, all the suffering—everything points to a terrible conclusion. Sophie had been planning not just to escape, but to erase everything she once knew. The truth is darker than you could have ever imagined. The princess had turned her grief into something monstrous, and now, the choice of whether to stop it lies with you.
