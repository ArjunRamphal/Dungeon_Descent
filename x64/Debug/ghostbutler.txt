You stagger through the crumbling remnants of an ancient crypt, the oppressive silence broken only by the soft, eerie rustle of your footsteps against the cold stone floor. A chilling draft brushes past you, carrying with it the faintest scent of decay and forgotten souls. As you enter a shadowy chamber, the darkness seems to cling to every corner, leaving only fleeting glimpses of what lies within.

In the centre of the room, a patch of the floor seems to ripple unnaturally, as if the earth itself is alive. A tremor runs through the ground, and you spot a figure—his form half-submerged in a dark, yawning grave. It's the Princess's butler! His tattered clothing clings to his body, once fine but now decayed, his arms flailing weakly as he's pulled deeper into the open grave.

"P-Please!" he gasps, his voice thick with panic and desperation. "Help me! The grave... it's dragging me down! I can't—!" His words are swallowed by the darkness as the earth seems to consume him, pulling him lower with every moment. His waist is already buried, his face contorted in terror, eyes wide with dread as his body sinks further into the cold embrace of the grave.

He was a servant of the princess—he may know something of importance—but as he struggles, a faint glint catches your eye. There, just at the edge of the grave, lies an old, dust-covered vial, its contents faintly shimmering with an ethereal glow. It's within reach if you choose to let the butler be swallowed by the grave.

The air grows heavy, thick with the weight of your decision. The chilling presence of the restless dead seems to press in around you, and the grave seems to whisper, beckoning you toward the darkness.

Will you reach for the vial, or will you save the butler from his grim fate, risking whatever lies hidden in the shadows of this forsaken place?
