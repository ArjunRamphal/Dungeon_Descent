The warrior rubs his freed wrists, wincing as circulation returns to his fingers. Then he looks up at you, his sharp, battle-hardened eyes narrowing. There’s no fear in them—only a grim amusement.

"Didn’t expect that," he mutters. His voice is rough, the voice of a man who has shouted orders over the clash of steel. "Most wouldn’t waste their time on a man like me."

You sheath your blade. "I don’t have time for this. Malvel has the princess locked away, and I need to—"

The warrior scoffs. "Locked away? Is that what she told you?"

You pause, a cold prickle running down your spine. "What are you saying?"

He rolls his shoulders, ignoring the stiffness in his limbs. Instead of answering, he steps toward the cell door, peering into the dim corridor beyond. "I’ve seen men like you before. The righteous type. Hero rides in, slays the villain, saves the princess. It’s always the same damn story."

Your patience wears thin. "Say what you mean."

The warrior turns back to you, his jaw tight. "I put my sword through the throat of House Falkreath’s leader. Cut him down myself on the battlefield. That’s why Malvel took me alive." His voice hardens like tempered steel. "You think he’s just some tyrant hoarding a princess? Malvel was Falkreath’s last heir. A son no one knew about. The war ended, but he fought on. And the princess?" He shakes his head. "You ever stop to wonder why he didn’t just kill her?"

Your grip tightens around your sword. "You’re saying there’s more to this?"

He exhales sharply, the sound half a bitter laugh. "I’m saying don’t be a fool. You want to know why he kept her here? Ask her yourself. But before you throw your life away fighting for a cause you don’t understand—" He nods toward the hall. "There’s another door past the Hall of Chains. Might be worth seeing what’s on the other side before you go swinging that blade."

Then, without another word, he steps into the darkness, leaving you alone with a truth you hadn’t considered.
