You step into a vast, echoing alcove, its walls made of crumbling stone that seems to dissolve into the mist hanging heavy in the air. The atmosphere is cold, and a faint, metallic scent clings to the air, like rusted iron. From the deeper shadows, a figure stirs. A towering zombie, its flesh pale and mottled, with ragged clothes clinging to its skeletal form, blocks your path. Its empty, milky eyes gleam with a hollow, unnatural light, fixed intently upon you.

The creatureâ€™s arms hang loosely at its sides, fingers twitching with an eerie, jerky rhythm as though responding to a long-forgotten impulse. A low, guttural groan emanates from its throat, a sound like the earth itself grieving, sending an icy chill through the air around you. Its jaw hangs open, revealing teeth stained with the remnants of past feasts, and a slow, unsettling hiss slips from its rotting lips.

Do you stand your ground, preparing for the grim confrontation, or do you melt back into the mist, hoping to evade its haunted gaze?
