You descend into a cavernous chamber lit by the pulsing glow of magma streams coursing through jagged fissures in the floor. The air is thick with ash and heat, each breath heavy like breathing through smoke. Stalactites hang like teeth from the ceiling, dripping molten rock into bubbling pools below.

Suddenly, you hear the guttural snarls echoing off the stone walls—winged shapes detach from the shadows above. A pack of Malvel’s minions—twisted, fire-scorched hounds with skeletal wings and molten eyes—circle you with sinister grace. Their leathery wings beat with unnatural strength, and smoke coils from their flared nostrils as they hover just out of reach, waiting for your move.

You feel the tension crackle in the air. These creatures could be destroyed—crushed beneath your will and blade, offering a surge of power from their essence. But there's another path. Their eyes hold more than malice; they hold knowledge. A well-placed threat, a show of dominance, and they might speak of Malvel's secrets... of what lies deeper within the molten halls.

Will you strike them down to grow stronger? Or make them speak, and learn what they know?
