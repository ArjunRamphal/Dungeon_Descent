You step into a vast, echoing grotto, the air thick with the sulphurous stench of molten rock and shimmering with oppressive heat. Rivers of incandescent lava snake across the cavern floor, casting dancing shadows on the obsidian walls. From the depths of this fiery expanse, a formidable shape stirs. A miniature dragon, no larger than a large dog but radiating intense heat, blocks your path. Its scales, the colour of cooling magma, are cracked and glow faintly with inner fire. Its reptilian eyes, like molten gold, fix intently upon you.

The creatureâ€™s scaled forelimbs, tipped with razor-sharp claws that drip with viscous, glowing lava, flex menacingly. A low, guttural growl rumbles from its chest, a sound like rocks grinding in a furnace, sending waves of heat rippling through the already scorching air. Its whip-like tail, tipped with a cluster of razor-sharp, obsidian-like spines that glow red-hot, twitches rhythmically, a silent promise of searing pain.

Do you stand your ground and face the lava mini dragon, or attempt to melt back into the shadows and evade its fiery gaze?
