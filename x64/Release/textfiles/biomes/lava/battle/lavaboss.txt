The heat hits you first—an oppressive wave that rises from the lava coursing through the cracks in the stone. You step into the arena, and there he stands: Malvel, looming on his obsidian throne. The flames around him cast eerie shadows on his cold, calculating face. Above him, Sophie is trapped in a cage, her eyes locked onto yours, but she remains silent.

Malvel grins, a smirk twisting his lips. “I’m surprised... I didn’t think anyone would make it this far. You’ve endured much to get here. But now... now you’ll see what this has all been for.”

You take a step forward, eyes never leaving the sorcerer. “Let her go, Malvel. This ends here.”

He chuckles darkly, rising from his throne with a fluid grace. “You think it’s that simple? You think you’ve come all this way just to defeat me? How quaint.”

Sophie shifts in her cage, her gaze sharp, yet unreadable. Her silence speaks volumes.

Malvel’s eyes glint with amusement. “You’ve fought valiantly, I’ll give you that. But no one truly wins here, not in the end. The story was written long before you even drew your sword.”

His words hang in the air, thick with mystery, as the tension between you both crackles like the heat of the molten rock beneath your feet.

“You’re out of time,” Malvel sneers. “Prepare yourself. This is where your journey ends.”
