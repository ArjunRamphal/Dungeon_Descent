Cassio was born into a poor family of farmers in the outer districts of the kingdom.

His parents, though struggling to make ends meet, instilled in him a strong sense of determination and resilience.

From a young age Cassio demonstrated a natural aptitude for the sword and combat, allowing him into the kingdoms army.

Cassio's exceptional skill and dedication quickly earned him recognition within the Kings Guard and soon he became a knight.

He grew to love the princess Sophie who he served as a personal guard on several occasions.

Yet he knows his social standing as poor farmer made him an unlikely suitor.

After hearing of her kidnapping by the evil wizard Malvel, the same wizard who killed his mentor Sir Henry, he became distraught and now seeks justice. With his sword made of dragon steel and the knowledge of countless battles he heads into the magical dungeon seeking to free her and make the kingdom recognise him as a warrior worthy of her love.
