You find a hidden letter buried deep in the well, the parchment damp but intact. As you unfold it, you notice the ink is smudged in places, the writing hurried and frantic.

The letter speaks of Eldred, his name appearing again and again with a sense of longing. "Eldred and I spent another quiet evening by the river. If only they knew... but they mustn't."

The tone grows more desperate: "My father would never approve. He will never allow us to be together, but I cannot deny what I feel. I will not leave him."

The last lines are a scrawl of pain: "They have taken him. I will avenge him, no matter the cost. Even if it means turning my back on everything."

The princessâ€™s love for Eldred was forbidden by her father. The truth lies in understanding who he is. He is the key to everything.
