You lunge forward, your hand trembling as you ignore the faint shimmer of the vial at the butler’s side, and with a desperate heave, pull him free from the cold, dark grave's grasp.

He collapses onto the stone floor, gasping for breath, his chest heaving as he coughs up dust and the remnants of the grave’s earth. After a long, harrowing moment, he slowly looks up at you, his expression a mixture of gratitude and fear. "Thank you, kind stranger... I owe you my life," he croaks, his voice hoarse, as though it had been trapped within the tomb’s oppressive silence for far too long.

His gaze flickers nervously to the shadows surrounding the crypt, and then his voice drops to a whisper, barely audible over the faint whispers of the restless spirits that seem to echo through the chamber. "The princess... she left me here to die. Because I knew her secret..."

He shudders, his hands trembling. "She was in love, you see. With Eldred, the leader of House Falkreath. But the King... he found out. He was furious. He... he killed Eldred."

A cold chill runs through you as the weight of his words settles upon your soul. The princess's secret lover was not just a man of love, but of danger—an enemy of her father's blood. It seems her heart, like the spirits of this haunted place, is bound by forbidden ties, darkened by betrayal and loss.

You press on, the crypt's walls growing ever colder, the very air thick with whispers and the weight of the princess's hidden truth. With this new knowledge, you move deeper into the heart of the dungeon, uncertain of what further darkness you may uncover.
