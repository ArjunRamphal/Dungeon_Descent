The ground trembles beneath your feet as the Ice Golem lumbers forward, each step sending a shockwave of cold through the chamber. Its massive, jagged body glistens like a frozen mountain, layers of ice shifting and cracking with every movement. Frost spills from its hulking form, coating the ground in a thick, treacherous sheet of rime.

With an ear-splitting roar, the golem raises one colossal arm, shards of ice forming along its fist before it crashes down, sending a blinding burst of frost into the air. The temperature plummets as icy winds lash at your skin, numbing your limbs and slowing your breath.

Its hollow, glowing eyes lock onto you, an unrelenting force of frozen power. The path ahead is slick with ice, but open—if you’re fast enough to slip past before it strikes again.

Do you engage the towering frostborn titan, or make a desperate dash past it before the cold seals your fate?
