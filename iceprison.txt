You trudge through the frozen corridors, your footsteps muffled by a thick layer of snow and the jagged icicles hanging from the ceiling like nature’s daggers. The air is frigid, each breath escaping in ghostly plumes. You come to a cell, its iron door encased in frost, the bars coated in a crystalline sheen of ice. Inside, a gaunt yet battle-hardened man hangs from the wall, his wrists and ankles bound by chains that have frozen over with time.

The prisoner, a warrior of the kingdom, shivers violently, his breath shallow and ragged. His once-proud armor is cracked and brittle from the cold, his flesh marred with frostbite. With great effort, he lifts his head to meet your gaze, his voice rasping through chattering teeth.

"You… you're not one of them…" He coughs, his breath steaming in the icy air. "Please… free me. The Frost Warden’s sentinels will return soon, and… and they'll make sure I don’t last another night."

His eyes, though dimmed by suffering, still hold the fire of a soldier—a man who once stood on the front lines of the war against House Falkreath. He may know the hidden paths through the tundra, the weaknesses in the Frost Warden’s defenses, or even the forgotten strongholds buried beneath the ice.

Yet, a darker instinct whispers within you. Slaying him could grant you something far greater—a surge of raw power, his warrior's strength seeping into your own. Perhaps the cold would bite less, your reflexes sharpen, your blows strike with the might of a dying soldier’s final battle.

The wind howls through the frozen halls, carrying the weight of your decision.
