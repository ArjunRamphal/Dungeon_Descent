You step into a heat-shimmering alcove carved into the side of a volcanic cliff, the air thick with the scent of sulphur, scorched rock, and singed parchment. Crimson lanterns cast flickering shadows across the obsidian walls, and the ground beneath your boots pulses faintly with warmth from the molten earth below.

Behind a jagged basalt counter stands Varkas, a stout figure cloaked in soot-streaked robes, his skin tanned and leathery from years spent in the inferno’s glow. His eyes gleam like molten gold beneath a char-black hood, and a faint smirk plays at the edge of his lips as he nods in greeting.

“Welcome, flame-walker,” he rasps, voice like gravel cracking under pressure. “Varkas, dealer in volcanic rarities, at your service. If you’ve come this far into the embered depths, you’re either desperate, or wise. Perhaps both.”

With a flourish of his scorched sleeve, he unveils a trio of rare and glimmering artifacts laid out on a heat-treated slab of obsidian:

“First, the Emberheart Elixir,” he says, lifting a glass vial that pulses with a dull red glow. “Drink it, and the fires within you shall burn bright once more—your wounds sealed by the heat itself.”

“Next, the Corebound Tincture.” He holds up a dense vial filled with swirling magma-coloured fluid. “Strength drawn from the heart of the mountain. One sip, and you’ll feel your blood run like liquid fire—unyielding and fierce.”

And finally, Varkas taps the flask with a clawed finger, his voice low and reverent:
"This here’s the Inferno Draught—drink it, and for a time, every part of you burns brighter: stronger, faster, sharper... but when the fire dies, it leaves its ashes."  

The heat intensifies slightly, as if the cavern itself awaits your decision.

Which of Varkas’s fiery offerings will you accept?
