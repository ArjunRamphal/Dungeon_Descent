You step into a vast, echoing chamber carved from solidified magma, the air thick with choking fumes and radiating an unbearable heat. Rivers of molten lava carve glowing paths through the darkness, illuminating jagged obsidian formations. From the fiery depths, a formidable figure emerges. A knight, clad in armour that seems forged from cooled volcanic rock, stands sentinel, blocking your path. Molten light seeps from the cracks and joints of his obsidian-like plating, and wisps of smoke curl from his gauntleted fists.

Where a face should be, there is only a shifting vortex of incandescent light, like staring into the heart of a forge. In one hand, he grips a massive greatsword, its blade shimmering with heat and dripping molten droplets that hiss as they hit the stone floor. The heat radiating from him is intense, and a low, resonant hum emanates from his armoured form, like the churning of a subterranean furnace.

Do you stand your ground and face the lava knight, or attempt to melt back into the shadows and evade his fiery presence?
