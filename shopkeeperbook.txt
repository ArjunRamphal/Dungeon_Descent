You open the shopkeeper's Book of Knowledge, its pages worn and well-thumbed. As you skim through the contents, one entry stands out—a detailed account of the war between House Falkreath and the Kingdom of Aethoria. The tone is different from other records, filled with quiet frustration and growing resentment.

The entry describes how House Falkreath, a once-proud and noble house, was forced into conflict after years of being unfairly treated by Aethoria. "Falkreath's people were hardworking, their lands rich, yet they were taxed heavily, their resources stripped to fuel Aethoria's ambitions."

It goes on to explain how the Falkreath nobility, once allies of Aethoria, found themselves pushed to the edge. "The final straw came when Aethoria's king demanded more than ever—land, crops, even soldiers for a war that was none of their making. Falkreath was left with no choice but to resist, despite the cost."

The book paints the war as a struggle of survival, not aggression. "It was not Falkreath that sought war, but Aethoria's unrelenting greed for power and control. The people of Falkreath fought not out of ambition, but necessity."

This portrayal of House Falkreath as a victim of exploitation shifts the narrative, suggesting that the war was sparked by unfair treatment, not by Falkreath's desire for conquest.
