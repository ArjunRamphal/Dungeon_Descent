# Dungeon Descent
 COMP315 Group 7 Project

## About:
In this story-based quiz fantasy adventure, players choose one of four heroes and venture into a magical dungeon to rescue a princess believed to be captured by the sorcerer Malvel. Along the journey, players must answer medieval-themed and lore-based riddles that test both their logic and their understanding of the game's hidden story. Correct answers will power up their hero’s stats—such as Strength, Wisdom, and Health—needed to survive in battles against powerful dungeon bosses.
The topic of the quiz centers around medieval riddles and story-driven knowledge related to the world’s history, characters, and betrayals. As players progress, their success in riddles and battles directly shapes their fate, leading to one of three possible endings. High stats and smart choices are crucial for defeating Malvel and uncovering the true nature of the princess and the kingdom’s buried secrets.
