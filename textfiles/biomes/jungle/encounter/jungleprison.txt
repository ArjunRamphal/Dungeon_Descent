You push forward through the dense, overgrown corridors, your footsteps muffled by the cold stone and the creeping vines that clings to the walls. You come to a cell, its iron door covered in a thick layer of moss and twisting vines. Inside, a gaunt yet battle-hardened man hangs from the wall, his wrists and ankles shackled by rusted chains.

The prisoner, a warrior of the kingdom, lifts his head, revealing deep scars and weary, sunken eyes. His once-proud armor is now in tatters, his body battered from months—perhaps years—of captivity.

"You..." he rasps, his voice hoarse from disuse. "You're not one of them... Please, release me. The Jungle Warden's hunters—those butchers—will return soon, and they'll not grant me another day of life."

His gaze is filled with a desperate determination. This man fought in the war against House Falkreath, once standing at the front lines of the kingdom’s greatest battles. He may know secrets of the Jungle Warden’s stronghold or the surrounding wildlands—knowledge that could prove invaluable.

Yet, a darker instinct within you whispers that killing him could grant you power—his warrior's spirit might feed your own, strengthening your body with his stolen vitality. The decision lingers, heavy in the damp air.
