You step into a grand, high-ceilinged chamber, the air thick with humidity and the scent of damp earth. Ahead of you, a figure emerges from the tangled shadows. A hulking, moss-covered creature—a Jungle Troll—blocks your path, its glowing yellow eyes burning with fury.

The troll grips a massive club, its wooden surface entwined with creeping vines and etched with ancient tribal runes. The air thrums with the deep, guttural growl rumbling from its chest, sending a primal warning through your bones.

Do you confront the beast or attempt to slip past unnoticed?
