You stumble into a colossal sandstone crypt, the air thick with the musty scent of decay and ancient spices. The chamber is dimly lit by flickering braziers, casting long, dancing shadows that writhe across hieroglyph-covered walls.

A low, guttural moan echoes through the crypt, vibrating through the sand-strewn floor beneath your feet. The temperature seems to drop subtly, a coldness that seeps deeper than the desert chill.

Suddenly, the tattered wrappings hanging in the shadows stir, and from a sarcophagus emerges a gaunt figure. Easily seven feet tall, the Crypt Lord, Ahmose The Pharoah, shuffles into the flickering light. Its form is a horrifying tapestry of dried flesh clinging to bone, wrapped in layers of age-old linen stained with the dust of centuries. But it’s the creature’s eyes that pierce the gloom—hollow sockets that glow with an eerie, inner luminescence, burning with the restless energy of the long dead.

Its desiccated hands, tipped with sharp, brittle nails, twitch with unnatural life. Funerary amulets and tarnished gold adorn its decaying form, and the air around it carries the faint whisper of forgotten incantations. As it groans, you can hear the dry rustle of its bandages, the very air feeling heavy with the weight of its ancient curse.

Ahmose’s movements are slow and deliberate, each step a dragging shuffle across the stone floor as it approaches, its emaciated form radiating an aura of death and decay. You feel a chill despite the desert heat, and the sheer unnaturalness of its presence fills the crypt with a suffocating sense of dread.

There’s no escape. Ahmose’s glowing eyes lock onto you, and its moan fills the air, a chilling sound that speaks of endless slumber disturbed. It lurches forward, moving with surprising persistence despite its decrepit form, its skeletal hands reaching out with a grasp that promises entombment, and the faint whisper of dark magic swirling around it.

The brazier flames flicker wildly, and the shadows deepen, the very stone seeming to absorb the life around you.

Flight feels impossible. Ahmose’s moan is unnerving, and its eyes burn with the cold light of the grave. It’s time to draw your weapon, hold your breath against the dust, and prepare for a desperate struggle against the ancient guardian of the crypt.
