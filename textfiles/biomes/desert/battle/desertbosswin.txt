The air is thick with dust, the desert heat oppressive. You stand over the defeated pharaoh mummy, the once-mighty figure crumpled at your feet. The sands shift around you, as if the very desert itself mourns the fall of its ancient ruler. But before you can catch your breath, the pharaoh’s raspy voice echoes in the silence.

"You... you don’t understand," he croaks, his ancient eyes flickering with the last remnants of life. "I overheard... them... in the dead of night."

You lean in, sensing his final words are important.

"Malvel... and the princess... they speak... of revenge... over wine..." His voice weakens, and he coughs, blood staining his lips. "She is... well fed... not a prisoner, no... no... a partner. They meet... late in the evening, their plans growing darker... darker still... of a kingdom's fall... and a father's blood... Her... motives..."

The pharaoh’s body trembles, his eyes glazed with the weight of the truth he’s shared. "You... you’re not... saving her... you’re... playing into their hands..."

With that, his body collapses, the sands swallowing his form as if he had never been there at all.
