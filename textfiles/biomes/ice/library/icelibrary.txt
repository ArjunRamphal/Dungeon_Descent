As you push open the heavy doors, a crisp, glacial light spills out, bathing you in its pale glow.
The air inside is sharp and biting, carrying the scent of frost-covered parchment and the hushed murmurs of knowledge long entombed in ice.
Towering shelves of frozen oak stretch toward the vaulted ceiling, their surfaces glistening with frost, groaning beneath the weight of countless tomes encased in thin layers of shimmering rime.

Your gaze drifts across the shelves, settling upon four leather-bound volumes that seem to pulse with an eerie, cold radiance. Each book bears an intricate, silver-embossed title, their covers slick with frost:
 

1. "The Art of Warfare": A tome bound in black leather, adorned with the symbol of a sword. Its pages are said to hold the secrets of combat.
2. "The Whispering Winds": A slender volume bound in sky-blue leather, bearing the emblem of a feather. Its words are whispered to carry the essence of the wind.
3. "The Ancient Lore": A massive tome bound in worn, brown leather, adorned with strange, mystical symbols. Its pages are said to hold the secrets of the arcane.
4. "The Heart of the Forest": A delicate volume bound in green leather, bearing the emblem of an eagle. Its words are whispered to carry the essence of sight.

Which book will you choose to read, and how will its secrets shape your journey?
