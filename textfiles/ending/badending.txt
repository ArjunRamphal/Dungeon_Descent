Malvel stands over you, his dark laughter echoing in the fiery depths of the arena. You lie on the ground, your body battered and broken, your weapon out of reach. The lava pools shimmer with a sinister glow, casting a hellish light over the scene.

“You were so certain,” Malvel sneers, his voice filled with cruel amusement. “So certain that you could save the princess. That you could stop me. But look at you now. All your efforts, all your hope... wasted.”

With a swift motion, he raises his hand, and a surge of dark magic crackles around him, gathering with destructive force. You try to move, to fight back, but your strength has long since faded. You can barely lift your head as Malvel steps closer, his smirk widening.

“You failed. And now, you will die knowing the truth. Your kingdom will burn, your people will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.”

His eyes glint with malice as the magic pulses around him, preparing to deliver the final, crushing blow.

“Goodbye, hero,” he whispers, his voice laced with mockery.

And with that, he strikes.
