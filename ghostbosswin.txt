The air is thick with dust, the desert heat oppressive. You stand over the fallen figure of Count Dracula, his once-immense power now reduced to a crumpled form at your feet. The sands shift, as though even the desert mourns the fall of this ancient, dark being. Yet, before you can catch your breath, a raspy voice echoes from the shadow of the night.

"You... you don’t understand," Dracula croaks, his bloodshot eyes flickering with the last remnants of life. "I overheard... them... in the dead of night."

You lean in, sensing his final words are far more important than you could have imagined.

"Malvel... and the princess... they speak... of revenge... over wine..." His voice weakens, a fit of coughing racking his body, blood staining his lips. "She is... well-fed... not a prisoner, no... no... a partner. They meet... in the silence of night, their plans growing darker... darker still... of a kingdom's fall... and a father's blood... Her... motives..."

Dracula's body trembles, his once-gilded presence now flickering away like an extinguished candle. "You... you’re not... saving her... you’re... playing into their hands..."

With a final, hollow gasp, his body slumps into the sands, the weight of his revelation heavy in the air. The desert takes him, as if he were never here at all.
